# 🐧 Day 2 — Linux Basics

## 🚀 Why Linux Matters
Linux is the **foundation of most servers, cloud platforms, and DevOps tools**.  
For a Full-Stack Developer or DevOps engineer, mastering Linux commands is essential to:
- Navigate and manage files directly from the terminal.
- Automate repetitive tasks using shell scripts.
- Control file permissions and ownership.
- Work with remote servers through SSH.
- Gain confidence with containerization and CI/CD tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions).

## ⚙️ Key Commands Learned
Here are some of the most important commands covered in this section:

- **File & Directory Navigation:** `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`
- **File Management:** `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `rm -r`, `rm -rf`
- **Viewing Content:** `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`
- **Search:** `grep` (with options like `-i`, `-n`, `-r`, `-v`)
- **Permissions & Ownership:** `chmod`, `chown`

## ⚠️ Safety Note: `rm -r` vs `rm -rf`
- **`rm -r`** → Deletes directories and contents recursively, but may ask for confirmation.  
- **`rm -rf`** → Deletes everything recursively **without confirmation** and ignores errors.  
⚠️ **Warning:** Misusing `rm -rf` (e.g., `rm -rf /`) can completely wipe a system. Always double-check your paths.
